					<p>It's really hard for me to look back on Etele's 10(!) years at Kinja and not imagine what might have been: what if the ad-based media revenue model wasn't in a death spiral; what if private equity attracted competent, well-meaning people; what if certain billionaires were never born, etc.</p>

					<p>But then I think about Etele's vibrant designs for top Hungarian news sites (which still hold up after many years), and imagine G/O Media sites with maybe 75-90% fewer ad units,¬†and I get inspired and remember how it felt when the internet was still an exciting and open place, and how it's a place where Etele's many contributions endure.</p>

					<p>It was a true honor to have had the chance to work with Etele on some very good websites. Besides being great at what he does, Etele is a ray of light, bringing joy wherever he goes. He is the kind of person who you can't walk a block with without running into friends,¬†whether you're in Brooklyn or Budapest. Digital media's loss is everyone who has the pleasure of working with Etele next's gain.</p>

					<p>I love this human. And his partner, cat, and plants. He is someone I hope to have in my life forever because of how he cares for everyone and everything. I‚Äôm so glad that our path crossed and intertwined our lives ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

					<p>Normally these would have some light roasting, but I don‚Äôt really have the capacity or desire to do that to Etele.¬†The company has lost another supremely talented person, square in the middle of their peak earning potential, and are all the worse because of it. I don‚Äôt know what they should give you for making it to 10 years, but it should likely be some kind of gilded statue, memorial plaque, or at the very least a large bonus to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. Congrats Etele!</p>

					<p>Many of you already know this, but in the 1940s there was a running joke about some Hungarian immigrants to the US¬†actually being Martians.</p>

					<p>I think about this often when I‚Äôm around Etele. Certainly I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs getting his sweatshirts from Mars, bc I do not see them at any terrestrial retailer. I‚Äôm also not sure about that carton of dinosaur eggs he once showed me.</p>

					<p>Regardless, I‚Äôm very happy that you found a new gig with some friends, Etele. Good luck, safe travels, and if you ever spill out of your bodysuit we‚Äôll get the men in black to help you out!</p>

					<p>A few months into my tenure at Gawker Media in 2013, the company threw one of its infamous parties on the 210 Elizabeth rooftop. The party was sponsored by a waterproof Sony mobile phone, so obviously invitees were encouraged to bring water guns, water balloons, buckets, and other dousing instruments. I was somehow both over and underprepared, deciding to theme myself as a firefighter, but not picking up my ‚Äúcostume‚Äù until 10 minutes before the party. I arrived in a brick red H&M deep V-neck tee, a too-small-for-my-big-ass-head plastic firefighter‚Äôs helmet, and a toddler-sized water tank backpack that had a hose running to a tiny pump-action squirter. I probably thought I looked cool.</p>

					<p>I spent the entire day running around in this ridiculous get-up, squirting pathetic amounts of water at everyone and everything. At some point, a bald man with a heavy Central European accent flagged me down. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúWow. Can I take your photo?‚Äù Sure, I thought, why not. What good is this fantastic outfit if I don‚Äôt allow strange men to photograph me in it?</p> 

					<p>The next workday, the entire tech team received an email from Etele, with the subject line ‚ÄúYEAH!!!!‚Äù, or something similarly excited and irreverent. To my horror, I discovered the content of the email was a full resolution attachment of me looking like an absolute chud in an image so large that you had to scroll vertically and horizontally to see it all.</p> 

					<p>Little did I know that, despite being embarrassed in front of my peers (it was my own fault, really), Etele would end up becoming one of my favorite people in the world. From the hazy afternoons on the Gawker rooftop to the late nights drinking froccs at Kozpont, Etele‚Äôs happy-go-lucky antics, love for corny sci-fi, and second-to-none dinner parties has made him a permanent fixture in my life, one who immediately uplifts my mood as soon as I see him. Long live Etele!</p>

					<p>Etele bazmeg!</p>

					<p>I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around you leaving <strike>Gawker Blogwire UniModa Univision FMG GMG Great Hill Partners G/O Media</strike> Kinja. Almost exactly 10 years ago, when I was on my way to move back from France to Hungary, you reached out to me. We used to work together at Index / Blog.hu, and you recently left them for Gawker. Gawker, for most of us, was this exotic, seemingly shady, but extremely cool thing in Budapest, a handful of people who nobody knew what they were doing, but their eccentric American owner threw incredible parties that half of Budapest‚Äôs media workers were invited to to mingle.</p> 

					<p>You reached out to me, because your new team was looking for a Technical Project Manager in Budapest (I still have the job description from Tom!), someone who, in the words of said job description, would ‚Äúmake things happen‚Äù. I was shit-scared at my interview, bending over that Skype microphone in the old Andr√°ssy office, realizing the gravity of the opportunity. (Fun fact: I never worked in that office, by the time I got an offer Gawker moved to the Hercegpr√≠m√°s street office.) You were so nice and reassuring, as always, that it‚Äôs going to be fine, everything is going to be fine. And everything was fine, indeed, for a pretty long time.</p>

					<p>Anyway, this is not a eulogy, and I‚Äôm not good in the usual roasting genre neither, so I‚Äôll just leave you with one advice for your undoubtedly stellar professional career: whenever someone tells you to stop sticking your nose into everything and just do your job, you should take it as a sign to start looking for the exit. Because the biggest value that you can provide to any company worth working for is that you care, with passion and love, for the product, for the people, for the business. (OK, you‚Äôre a pretty damn good designer too.)</p>

					<p>Take care, hugyos sarok visszav√°r, hope to see you soon.</p>

					<p>We are gathered here today to witness the end of an era and to¬†celebrate¬†new beginnings üéâ</p>

					<p>Etele, you bright and brilliant creature. It‚Äôs such an honor to still be in contact even though our official Gawker days are now a closing chapter. The lifelong friendship is everlasting. I miss getting instructions blasted by your tiny¬†megaphone even though we shared the same desk sitting next to each other. A true and devoted captain, you stayed with the¬†design team ensuring that we‚Äôve all moved on before embarking on your own adventures. See you soon and congratulations!</p>

					<p>Much love.</p>

					<p>Actually the one thing that I remember from the time I worked with Etele was there was one day that AWS was down or something and it caused most of our services to be down. In order to make a ticket for me he created this:</p>
